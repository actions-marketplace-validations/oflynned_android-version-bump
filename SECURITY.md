# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |

| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Steps

1. Create a new issue under the issues tab
2. Provide context and information around the vulnerability observed
3. Make sure to add the `security` label
4. You can provide a PR if you want to fix it immediately by assigning the issue to yourself
5. Use conventional commits to describe your changes so that the semantic version will reflect the changes

Issues are dealt with on no fixed schedule, however they will be dealt with as soon as possible for urgent situations if no PR is provided.

Accepted PRs will be merged down and published.
